# Proxi

**[Trello board](https://trello.com/b/Qc2EXxbk)**

### ideas

**php**
- maybe add php base
- also utilise php for form validation + file reading, saving
	- plus, look into node js, which can be used instead of php

**project name**
- find a name for the project
	- frank
	- prox[i/y]

**file saving**
- save img / [done] files

- maybe consider logging everything on the console -- as a debug function?
- p5js.org
- orientation, https://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/device/orientation/
- face recog -- trackerJS
- object detection
- [done] system sounds

- use boolean switch for this
- speak current time and date

### next
- [done] gather inspiration for ui
	- the amazing work of Jayse Hansen
	- also the amazing work of the Cantina Creative studio team
- create color palette
