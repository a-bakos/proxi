# homebot project

### ideas

- add access to camera
- dive into JS regexp
	- see if JS can read source code with it
- maybe add php base
- also utilise php for form validation + file reading, saving
	- plus, look into node js, which can be used instead of php
- find a name for the project
- reload / refresh / empty memory
- save img / files
- overall volume voice control
- status bar:
	- location
	- listening status
	- $_SERVER details
	- date / time
- media player, <audio>, <video>
- notepad:
	- eg. shopping list
- full log of events

### screen sections

- main action screen 1
- main action screen 2
- status bar
- last command list
- saved files
- one more section ?
